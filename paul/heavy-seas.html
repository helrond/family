                        <h2>My First Voyage</h2>

                        <p>I wonder if you think that every sailor lived on the beach so that the
                            ocean could flood his house? My home was 100 miles from the ocean at New
                            York City, and I had only lived there two years before I started to go
                            to sea. I was a sailor for six and a half years. For that, you have to
                            go on the ocean. I've sailed on the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, the
                            Caribbean, the North and South Pacific Oceans, the Indian Ocean, the
                            Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, The Red Sea, the
                            Suez Canal and Panama Canal. Can you find them in your atlas? I went
                            once clear around the world, going through the Panama Canal where it was
                            exciting to go up three locks and down three locks.</p>

                        <p>I had an Uncle Freddy, no relation: he was Aunt Bee's brother. Aunt Bee
                            married Uncle John first. Uncle John was a police officer in NYC, and he
                            used to take us down to the police station. Everybody knew him. When
                            Uncle John died, she married Uncle Arthur who was Mama's brother. Uncle
                            John was no relation to us, but because our real Uncle Arthur lived with
                            them, we called them Aunt and Uncle. Anyhow, they were pretty high up;
                            they drove a Pierce Arrow, and always had money to spend.</p>

                        <p>Uncle Freddy was a chief mate or stand by captain with the United Fruit;
                            they were the white boats that plied the banana trade from Central
                            America up to the east coast of the United States, carrying passengers
                            and bananas, and other fruit. Anyhow, he knew that I loved the sea, and
                            he offered to use his influence to help me get on board a ship. He told
                            me to come down to New York to Pier 32, where the Moore-McCormack lines
                            sail from. So three days after I graduated from high school, while I was
                            still 17, I went down to Pier 32, and I sat in their hiring hall while
                            the <i>SS Brazil</i> was getting ready to sail that night. The
                                <i>Brazil</i> was a big passenger ship going to Buenos Aires in
                            Argentina. Moore-McCormack had three passenger liners; the
                            <i>Brazil</i>, the <i>Argentina</i>, and the <i>Uruguay</i>. (Brothers
                            and sisters sailing from the USA to Paraguay may have sailed on these
                            ships.)</p>

                        <p>I was there about 4:00 pm with one other young fellow who was also
                            waiting for a chance to hire on. Now the <i>Brazil</i> had hired its
                            crew and they all had to be on board by midnight. At 10 o'clock this one
                            night the bursar came along and saw two of us young kids sitting there.
                            You guys want to go to sea? Yes! Yes! Which one of you? Well, we were
                            both standing on our feet. He said, &quot;Will you toss a coin?&quot; We
                            said, Yes, and I won the toss. </p>

                        <p>So I was quick put in a taxi and ferried up to Union Hall and given what
                            they call a trip card to be a tourist waiter in the 3<sup>rd</sup> class
                            dining room on the <i>SS Brazil</i>. (It was a union ship, sailing under
                            the National Maritime Union.) In fifteen minutes he got me a trip card
                            which allowed me one trip on this ship as tourist waiter. I signed on
                            that ship as a tourist waiter because of my experience with clam bakes
                            there in Modena. I did a lot of waiting at tables in Church suppers,
                            which are quite similar to our dining room service. I knew how to serve
                            people. At least, I thought I did. </p>

                        <p>So anyhow, they dumped me on board, and showed me where I was to bunk.
                            They called it a &quot;glory hole&quot;, and that's what it was. This
                            glory hole had triple-decker bunks. And I was introduced to one guy who
                            was supposed to be the head waiter, and I was told that he would take
                            care of me. So I asked him if he'd be sure to wake me up to get to the
                            dining room on time (I had to be there at 7:00 to get the tables set up
                            and get familiarized with the kitchen - they call it a galley.) </p>

                        <p>I remember that night very well. I didn't go straight to bed. I went out
                            onto the stern of the ship, the <i>Brazil</i>, and stood there
                            day-dreaming and thinking what a glorious opportunity this was, and I
                            could hardly believe my luck at landing the job and being off on the
                            ocean. I couldn't wait; I had what is called &quot;channel fever&quot;
                            among sailors; the urge to feel the throb of the ship working its way
                            down the channel to sea. (Mom says I still get channel fever.) Here I
                            was on board a ship heading to Buenos Aires, down past the Bahamas, to
                            Trinidad, to Rio and Santos, and Montevideo and Buenos Aires.</p>

                        <p>Well anyhow, the head waiter didn't want me on board. He saw my coming as
                            an inroad on his domain, so he didn't wake me up. When I finally woke
                            up, I only had about fifteen minutes to spare before I was supposed to
                            be serving the guests. I rushed up to the tourist dining room where I
                            was to be a waiter, and found out which tables I was supposed to take
                            care of. I got a list of the passengers assigned to those tables, and
                            then I was hustled up to the galley and shown where to get the food. </p>

                        <p>The dining room opened. We were at sea already, and the only people that
                            came in were a young couple on their honeymoon, and two Catholic
                            Priests; they were the only people I had at my tables for breakfast that
                            morning. Well, I took their orders and went out to the galley. I filled
                            out their orders, piled the food on my tray, brought it in and served
                            them. Not course by course, but the whole bang-shoot at once. </p>

                        <p>Anyhow, breakfast was over and as I was cleaning up the tables after the
                            guests had left, the Third Tourist Waiter Steward came over to me and
                            said, &quot;Son, where did you learn to wait tables?&quot;</p>

                        <p>I says, &quot;Well, I waited tables in the church.&quot;</p>

                        <p>He says, &quot;I thought so. How would you like to sign on as mess [crew]
                            waiter?&quot; </p>

                        <p>Well, I knew my rights, and I knew that they couldn't fire me once I was
                            at sea. I was earning $15 a month and tips, and the trip would last 38
                            days. So I said, &quot;Well what's in it? What's the
                            difference?&quot;</p>

                        <p>He says &quot;You'll get $40 a month up there, and tips.&quot;
                            (Grandfather Tom Potts said, I bet you didn't get much in tips from the
                            crew! Dad, Not a bit!)</p>

                        <p>Now $40 was a whole lot more than $15, and there were tips too; $40
                            looked awful good. So I says &quot;Sure, I'll take it.&quot; So he took
                            me up to the galley, introduced me to the Chief Steward, who showed me a
                            bit of the ropes (not too many) and took me down to the mess hall for
                            the deck gang. There were three mess halls on the <i>Brazil</i>: one for
                            the deck gang, one for what we call the &quot;black gang, the engine
                            room crew, and one for the unlicensed personnel; the bosons and the
                            people who were not the officers, but in charge of us merchant seamen.
                            So I settled in there and served the crew. I got their meals hot on a
                            trolley in kitchen soup containers which were wheeled into a hot deck in
                            my mess hall. And I served 24 men their meals: their breakfast, lunch,
                            and supper. </p>

                        <p>There was one man on there, an old Irishman, Paddy O'Flannigan, who took
                            a shine to me, and after about three or four days, he said to me,
                            &quot;Say, son, you don't want to be a steward all your life, do
                            you?&quot;</p>

                        <p>And I said no.</p>

                        <p>So he says &quot;When I'm off duty, come up on deck with me, and I'll
                            show ya a bit of seamanship.&quot; </p>

                        <p>So when I wasn't washing dishes or serving the crew, he took me up on the
                            fo'cslehead, and I sat on a hatch with him. He taught me the rules of
                            the road, how to tie knots, macrame, knitting, how to splice. He taught
                            me the weather, and a bit about the Morse Code and a lot of the things
                            like that which you need to know to be a sailor, and kept me out of
                            mischief too. When I signed off the Brazil, (I couldn't go another trip
                            on it, I had only one trip authority) Paddy told me to go up to the
                            Lifeguard station from Battery Park and sit for the Ordinary Seaman
                            Exam. I did, and passed thanks to Paddy's teaching.</p>

                        <p>It was on the Brazil that I crossed the Equator. There was an awful
                            bump!</p>

                        <p>I couldn't get back on that ship because I was only there for one trip
                            and a trip card, that's all its good for. You can go back to Union Hall
                            and wait, but it might be months before another ship might come
                            along.</p>

                        <h2>The F. Q. Barstow</h2>
                        <h3>Adventures in the Gulf of St. Lawrence &amp; the Hudson</h3>

                        <p>Well, I still couldn't get a job on a union ship without doing it the way
                            I'd done on the Brazil. Uncle Freddy said &quot;Standard Oil of New
                            Jersey is looking for seamen. Go down to their office and see if you can
                            get in there.&quot; He said ESSO was hiring to recommission an old
                            tanker they had mothballed after the First World War.</p>

                        <p>So I went over to Bayonne, to their office on lower Broadway. Sure
                            enough, they put me on an old rust-bucket they had hauled out of the
                            graveyard down in Newport News, Virginia. They put the whole crew on a
                            Pullman train and we went down. The next day we went to sea in this
                            bucket of rust called the <i>F.Q. Barstow. </i>Well, it was a nice ship.
                            We took this old tanker out; I was an Ordinary Seaman, and that was the
                            beginning of my career on deck.</p>

                        <p>I sailed that thing for six months. We sailed from Newport News to the
                            gulf coast of Texas, up and down the coast around Florida and the
                            straights between Cuba and Florida, and up the coast as far as Montreal.
                            We sailed down south either to Aruba, Curaçao or Aransas Pass. Wed load
                            up there and then come north to Baltimore, Boston, New York, or
                            Montreal. We carried crude oil. </p>

                        <p>I loved the 2<sup>nd</sup> Mate on the Barstow. He loved hot stuff and I
                            did too. We had a running battle going on who liked it better. When we
                            got to Mexico, we got a bottle of Jalapeños and that settled it.</p>

                        <p>We went down south to some place in the Caribbean, loaded up with oil,
                            and took it to Montreal. When we got off the Grand Banks, before we got
                            into the Gulf of the St. Lawrence between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia,
                            we sailed into a very, very dense fog, so dense that you couldn't see
                            the fo'cslehead from the bridge, which was only about a third of the
                            length of the ship.</p>

                        <p>The Ordinary Seaman is the lowest of the low on board a ship, except for
                            the wipers, who are the same in the engine room. I was assigned to the
                            12:00 to 4:00 watch, which is the Second Mate's watch. The Ordinary
                            Seaman stands the first hour of that watch as lookout, then he steers
                            the ship for two hours, and finally he stands the last hour of the
                            four-hour watch as lookout. </p>

                        <p>Well, one day in the dense fog, I was up there on the fo'cslehead where
                            the ship's bell hangs. In such a fog, you bang that bell as loud as you
                            can every two minutes, and then listen for an answering bell from any
                            other ship that might be in the vicinity, you couldn't possibly see them
                            in a fog like that. (I'm surprised they didn't use the ship's whistle,
                            because you could have heard that for miles.) But anyhow, I was up there
                            banging on the bell and all of a sudden I realized there was some light
                            behind me. Now there are two forestays coming down from the mast to the
                            bow of the ship, and there was some light dancing on these forestays,
                            coming down on the upper and the lower one. And each time they danced
                            they came a little bit further down the forestays. In about five minutes
                            the lights were practically down to me. </p>

                        <p>I was in a sou'wester, oilskins with metal overshoe buckles to close it,
                            and suddenly the fire jumped from the forestays to my buckles. I was
                            frightened to death! I lay down on the deck to roll it off, hollering
                            and screaming, and rolling to put the fire out. The Second Mate was up
                            on the bridge, and laughing his head off. He'd seen the light coming
                            down, knew what it was, and knew that it wouldn't harm me.</p>

                        <p>I discovered, after things got calmed down, that it was what they call
                            St. Elmo's Fire, and that it was a static electricity that made the fog
                            glow. It wasn't fire, and it didn't burn. I've since seen the same kind
                            of glow in the water as we were traveling through the Gulf Stream. In
                            the warm water, the ship going through the water would make the algae in
                            the water come to life and light up. It was just like this St. Elmo's
                            fire, and particularly beautiful in the ship's wake where the propeller
                            wash was stirring it up.</p>

                        <p>The old sailors on whaling ships would do things like scrimshaw carving
                            to keep themselves occupied. Scrimshaw is the part of the whale where
                            plankton is sifted. They would etch it, then rub ink in to make it dark,
                            and then do engravings on it. I did macrame; I would buy twine at the
                            ports and then weave belts etc out of this colored twine. I also built
                            model ships. Sometimes I would get books on sailing ships so I could
                            make models of them. I had a friend who did the same with trains. He
                            would make model railroads all out of thin brass, which he could bend.
                            One of the models I built was a 2 ft model called The Flying Cloud. It
                            was a clipper ship. I built this on a ship where I really liked the
                            captain. The feeling was mutual. Anyhow, the captain really liked the
                            model, so I gave it to him for his son. It took me about 6 months to
                            make. We had quite a bit of time for projects at times. The normal day
                            was work 4 hours, then 8 off, work 48 off. The first mate had the 4-8
                            watch, the 3<sup>rd</sup> mate the 8 12 watch, and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            mate the 12 4 watch. That's the one I liked the best. Of course, when
                            you are an officer, you can't choose.</p>

                        <p>It was on that same ship, Barstow, a trip or two later, that we
                            experienced a hurricane in about the same area. One of the duties of the
                            Ordinary Seaman is to call the watch. Now I don't know how that cleared
                            with the look-out on the bow, but his duty was to go back and call the
                            watch, make the coffee for them, and then come back and finish his
                            watch. During this storm, we were standing our watch on the bridge
                            instead of on the fo'cslehead. On these tankers the only way to get to
                            the bridge from the rest of the ship was via the catwalk, which is about
                            ten feet above the deck. </p>

                        <p>It was time for me to make the coffee and wake the watch. I went back
                            aft, made my coffee, called the next watch, and started back to the
                            midship house to finish my watch. Just then she took a real green one
                            overboard. I felt it coming and grabbed hold of the rails of the catwalk
                            so I wouldn't get washed overboard, because the water was that high.
                            When the wave was over and off of us, I looked back, and behind me the
                            catwalk was gone! I didn't waste any time going the rest of the way, I
                            got out of there as fast as I could. But with the catwalk gone, the next
                            watch couldn't get to the bridge to relieve us, and we (the 12:00 to
                            4:00 watch) spent the rest of that night, all the next morning and the
                            afternoon doing the navigation and conning the ship in this storm. That
                            was a rather memorable experience.</p>

                        <p>My best job was being look out on the bow. In warmer seas you could see
                            the porpoise (the sailors word for dolphins) jumping out of the bow
                            wave. I could watch them for hours swim back and forth across the bow
                            cutting through the water. They were beautiful and such playful
                            swimmers. You know, a sailor will never harm a porpoise.</p>

                        <p>On one journey to Venezuela, we sailed far up the river (I've forgotten
                            its name now) to the refineries. The river was too narrow there to turn
                            around before loading. So we went upstream a ways. The jungle spilled
                            over the banks and we could grab branches and shake the monkeys onto the
                            deck. To turn, we had to put her rudder hard over, and the bow plowed
                            into the jungle. Monkeys rained down on the deck, picked themselves up,
                            surprised, and then disappeared over the side back into the jungle as
                            fast as they could scramble. Then we backed out, stern upstream so we
                            could head back down and fuel up. We had to do this maneuver while we
                            were empty and drawing very little draft. Once we were fully load, were
                            pretty low in the water. At the mouth of the river was a big sand bar.
                            So we didn't tank up completely full. When we got down to the river
                            mouth, the engineer called for full steam, and we rammed the sandbar.
                            You could feel the hull grating over. We were lucky there were no rocks.
                            But that's the only way we got out. </p>

                        <p>We sank that ship in New York Harbor. This first tanker I was on; we'd
                            come up the East River, under the Tri-borough Bridge, up into the Bronx
                            and unloaded. This was in February. We had unloaded at Hunts Point power
                            station in the Bronx and were not in ballast yet. A tanker is even worse
                            than a freighter unloaded. They only draw three or four feet forward,
                            and not even enough to bury the propeller aft, and float very high out
                            of the water; probably about 20 feet between the deck and the water. We
                            were coming down in a howling windstorm; it was snowing. I think the
                            pilot must have been in his cups; anyhow he didn't keep her in the
                            middle of the channel and got off the side under Hellgate Bridge (the
                            railroad runs across on that bridge). I was down in the fantail stowing
                            our lines because we were heading south to Texas.</p>

                        <p>The first job an ordinary seaman has is to stow the lines that are used
                            to moor the ship. They're lines probably two or three inches in
                            diameter. I was in the afterdeck stowing lines down in the fantail,
                            flaking this line out the way it's supposed to be so it would dry and
                            not rot and mildew. I felt the ship go bump, bump, bump bump and the
                            rope, the hawser, stopped coming down. I knew something was wrong
                            because ships don't do that. I poked my head outside and sure enough,
                            wed gotten over out of the channel and ripped a gash in her bottom right
                            through the engine room. It wasn't long before the engine crew was up
                            out of the engine room, yelling, &quot;We're sinking!&quot; </p>

                        <p>There were two tugs going by, and we whistled them in under the emergency
                            rules of the sea. They hooked on us and got us turned around and headed
                            back up towards Flushing Flats, where the worlds fair had been, not far
                            from LaGuardia air field. They beached us there. At high tide the water
                            came just a foot and a half short of invading our crew quarters. There
                            was no steam in the boiler room, no lights, no nothing. </p>

                        <p>We spent the night on board that ship, and the next morning there
                            appeared four tugs with huge pumps. They put those six pumps on board
                            our afterdeck, stuck their snouts down into the engine room, and started
                            pumping water overboard. They pumped it out faster than it could come
                            in, so when she floated again, the four tugs turned us around and towed
                            us down the river to the Bethlehem shipyard, next to the Brooklyn navy
                            yard. There the crew was signed off, but they kept me as night watchman
                            there. I didn't have to live on board; I lived with Aunt Bee and Uncle
                            Arthur out on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, and went over to the shipyard
                            every night and spent the night there. I don't remember ever being as
                            cold as I was then. There was no heat on board the ship except a little
                            electric radiator, and I tell you, it was cold!</p>

                        <p>I spent the next two months as night watch on that ship, while it was in
                            dry dock. You walk around and make sure that nobody is stealing anything
                            like ships equipment. The stores were probably all messed up because
                            they were under water, but the linen and life boats; they couldn't have
                            gotten the life boats out anyhow. It was policy to have a night watch
                            man for securitys sake. This was my second ship, and before we were in
                            the war. </p>

                        <p>Europe was at war, but our ships were all lit up and we were sailing up
                            and down the coast. Until Pearl Harbor day, our ships were sailing fully
                            lit, with a big American flag painted on the side. If you were caught at
                            sea the day of Pearl Harbor, the crew turned to and painted that ship
                            gray right there at sea. They didn't wait to get home. They must have
                            been expecting it, they had the paint on board.</p>

                        <p>When the ship was recommissioned and ready to go again, they asked me if
                            I wanted to sail it, and I said, No, thank you, I don't want to sail on
                            it. So I went home for a while, and then went back to ESSO and signed on
                            another tanker. This ship, the <i>ESSO Augusta,</i> was a brand new
                            tankerred, red decks, a huge big diesel engine, boilers (to heat the
                            crude oil which we carried) in the upper part of the ship, and the
                            crew's quarters sandwiched in between. </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>The ESSO Augusta</h2>
                        <h3>Whales, Hot Nights, and the Texas Rangers</h3>

                        <p>Well, that ship was fast. You could fit a VW Bug in one of her cylinders.
                            The old <i>Barstow</i> was lucky if she could get up to ten knots, and
                            for that she probably had to have a tail wind. But the <i>ESSO
                                Augusta</i> would do eighteen knots easily. We went down to Texas to
                            get fuel and bring it back up to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston.
                            One time we were coming north, and we were a little bit late. No one
                            knew why, but we were not making such good time as we should have been,
                            and the Captain was cussing the engineers out because we weren't making
                            good time. But the engineer said we had all the power he could give us,
                            so we had to accept it. </p>


                        <p>We stopped for the pilot off of the Chesapeake entrance, and the pilot
                            says &quot;What's that whale doing across your bow?&quot; Now this was
                            one of the newer kind of ships, and instead of having a very sharp bow,
                            it had a bulb that stuck out in front under the waterline. The Romans
                            knew how to do that. They had a bow like that out in front underneath
                            the water on their galleys. It made the ship go easier for some reason
                            or other. Anyhow, we backed off of this whale, and sure enough, she got
                            up to speed again. (The children always wanted to know what happened to
                            the whale, and why did he get stuck on the bulb in the first place. Dad
                            said he was probably an old or sick whale; they were too fast to be
                            caught by a ship like that normally. The whale was dead when the pilot
                            told them about it, and when they backed, it slipped off their bow and
                            sank.)</p>

                        <p>Now the ship had a beautiful air conditioning system, but the Steward was
                            too tight to run it. He was trying to run an economical ship, and the
                            way to save money and impress the owners of the ship was not to run the
                            air conditioners. The cargo was crude oil which has to be heated to
                            pump. The crew quarters were sandwiched between the engine room and the
                            boiler for heating the crude. The Gulf of Mexico was hot; over 100
                            degrees, and the crew <i>roasted</i>. As summer wore on, and it got
                            hotter and hotter down south, the crew decided that if they wouldn't run
                            the air conditioning, we would take our mattresses out on deck and sleep
                            there. It was much cooler out there than it was in our rooms. But the
                            Steward got mad and raised a fuss about that, told us we couldn't use
                            our mattresses out on deck, it was getting them too dirty! So then we
                            struck ship, and sat her down (said we wouldn't sail the ship anywhere).
                            We said we wanted a company union, and we wanted to talk with the port
                            steward, the ship steward, and the engineers, and get the air
                            conditioning running. </p>

                        <p>We did that in Galveston, Texas. Well, the outcome was that about three
                            hours later the Texas Rangers (police) came marching down the dock. We
                            were expecting this to happen, and I had my duffel packed. Sure enough,
                            we were run off the ship. </p>

                        <p>So we marched off the ship, and let them have it. That was the last Esso
                            ship that I sailed. I traveled home from the Gulf by train. I had my
                            overboard wallet in my coat pocket. A nice little girl was on the train.
                            She got off at Chattanooga. When I got to DC, I found that my wallet had
                            gotten off at Chattanooga too. All I had in my pocket was my loose
                            change that was three or four dollars. I bought a ticket for as far as
                            my money would go. </p>

                        <p>When I got to Port Authority in New York City and found the next bus, I
                            only had a nickel. I was going to beg a ride. Fortunately for me, the
                            bus driver happened to be the fellow who had driven our school bus my
                            senior year at Wallkill High School. He said &quot;Get on, Ill take you
                            home! So he took me all the way to Arlen Corners (where Rt 44/55 crosses
                            208) and I got off there. I don't know if he paid my fare out of his own
                            pocket, but I was lucky that trip.</p>

                        <p>That ended my sojourn with ESSO (Every Saturday and Sunday Off we used to
                            call it, jokingly). I had been on two ESSO ships, the <i>Barstow</i>,
                            and the <i>ESSO Augusta</i>. </p>

                        <p>I switched to United Fruit and sailed one trip on that. *Uncle Freddy
                            trip with United Fruit; bosun on his tail because he was the captains
                            uncle. (Jaa remembers Dad telling that he did one trip with Uncle Freddy
                            as captain, because he wasn't a union sailor (couldn't pay the dues, and
                            they had not gotten their pay from the Augusta). Uncle Freddy offered to
                            take him on his United Fruit run to South America. But even though their
                            names were different, and neither of them told anyone, somehow someone
                            in the crew found out that Dad was related to the Captain, and the Bosun
                            really made Dads life miserable that trip. The worst was being sent to
                            clean out the gangway around the banana bunkers. The porters used these
                            as latrines when they loaded the bananas, and it was no picnic to be
                            assigned to clean them out by himself. When down in South America, Uncle
                            Freddy got orders to go take command of another ship. The remainder of
                            the trip without him on board was even more miserable.)</p>

                        <p>Anyhow, I loved the sea it was wonderful. On the calm days you had a
                            horizon, clear like this and you could see the whole sky. We had storms.
                            I never got seasick. No two days were alike. In the North Atlantic there
                            were gray seas. Down by Bermuda and south, the sea turned blue then
                            green. Bermuda is off the north coast of South America. This is the
                            hurricane spawning area. The other thing I loved from that area and the
                            Gulf Stream was the phosphorescence. It was some kind of bug or sea life
                            in the water that was like fireflies and the whole sea would shine with
                            them. Sometimes there would be a burst and it would spread out for
                            miles. Other times the ship would stir up clouds of it. The bow wave
                            would break sheets of these things that would go out ahead of the ship
                            and you could see them in the propeller wash behind us for a mile or two
                            so beautiful! I never saw it higher than 15 12 degrees North; definitely
                            no higher than 30 degrees North. </p>

                        <p>The Caribbean is full of every kind of fish. On a loaded tanker the deck
                            is only 6 or 8 feet out of the water. When I wasn't on lookout, I would
                            walk the decks and look for the flying fish that would jump on board and
                            couldn't get off. It was my job to collect them on the 4-8 watches and
                            give them to the cook in the galley for the skippers breakfast. I
                            managed a few for myself too. We watched the dolphins, or porpoises as
                            we sailors called them, playing with the ship as we traveled through.
                            The Esso Augusta could do 18 knots, and they had no trouble going back
                            and forth across the bow and jumping out of the bow wave. </p>

                        <p>Each ocean is different. I didn't have that much experience with the
                            Pacific, but the prevailing winds on the West Coast are on shore but on
                            the East Coast are on and off shore. Some of the differences in oceans
                            may have to do with the ocean floor. Sometimes you can just feel that
                            something is changing, like the Grand Banks. It is the shallow part of
                            the North Atlantic, southeast of Newfoundland. It feels different when
                            you enter it because the wave pattern changes. The Gulf Stream also you
                            can see and feel when you enter it. The North Atlantic can be rugged
                            sailing; especially in winter.</p>

                        <p>Nature at sea was wonderful; to see the huge display of the stars and the
                            planets in the sky and the wonderful ocean. </p>

                        <p>But the atmosphere on the ships was lousy, on very few of them was there
                            any kind of working together. It was dog eat dog and climb on your
                            brothers back. Well it came a point that I decided I didn't want to be
                            in the focsle anymore, so I enrolled in an officers training school. </p>

                        <p>The end of the Esso Augusta story came a year after we were run off the
                            ship. The whole crew of the Augusta had been black balled (black
                            listed?). That meant none of them could get jobs with Esso anymore. The
                            Maritime Union wanted the Esso sailors to join them. So the Maritime
                            Union took on the Esso Augusta case on the crews behalf, and won it a
                            year later. The crew all got back pay for a full year as if employed
                            with Esso, and were given a Union license as well. In our books ESSO
                            stood for eat, sleep, squawk, and overtime!</p>

                        <h2>College and World War II starting</h2>

                        <p>I had had one and a half years sailing in peace time. We weren't at war
                            until December of 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. In peace time we
                            sailed with huge American flags pained on the side of the ship and all
                            our lights on. We started to paint the ship gray the day after Pearl
                            Harbor. Yes, we had cannon too after Pearl Harbor. The Navy manned them.
                            At one point they sent us to gunnery school in England for the Normandy
                            invasion. We were expected to know how to handle aircraft guns.</p>

                        <p>I applied to Antioch, Ohio, in 1941, after the Augusta and before the
                            Cacique. They had a work/study program. You did one semester at Antioch
                            and then one semester of work. I did my first semester at Antioch and
                            then Pearl Harbor happened. The day after Pearl Harbor, I went to
                            Newburgh and applied for the Navy. They turned me down because I was
                            wearing glasses.</p>

                        <p>My second semester at Antioch was work in Cleveland Ohio. In Cleveland I
                            realized I was subject for the draft, so I went back to sea. The draft
                            had started while I was at Antioch, so I used Antioch, Yellow Springs OH
                            as my home address, and that was my draft board.</p>

                        <h2>The Cacique</h2>
                        <h3>Barracuda &amp; Porpoise</h3>

                        <p>The next ship I sailed on was called the <i>Cacique</i> (pronounced
                                Ka-<b>seek</b>). It's the Spanish word for King. Now this little
                            ship was anything but a king! It was a short tub, two hundred feet long
                            at the most, narrow, and slow. If it got up to six knots with a tail
                            wind, it was doing good, and then the engineer had to sit on the safety
                            valve! It was also a World War I vintage ship. We sailed out of Philly
                            down the inland passage through the Chesapeake and down the coast until
                            we got into the Caribbean all alone. That ship was so fast that if you
                            had a head wind of twenty miles an hour, you'd make two knots
                            astern.</p>

                        <p>I was at sea on the <i>Cacique</i> when war was declared. Now I don't
                            know how we happened to have a whole batch of gray paint on board, but
                            we did, and when we got into Cartagena harbor in Columbia, our job was
                            to paint that ship and camouflage it. It was a lot of nonsense, but
                            nevertheless that was what we did. By this time I was an AB, an Able
                            Bodied Seaman, the next rank up from an Ordinary Seaman. Being an AB, I
                            was sent over the side on a scaffold plank, a plank about eight feet
                            long hung by two ropes from two blocks on the deck. </p>

                        <p>Now, Laurel and I had been going together for a while by then, and she
                            had given me her Cornell ring to wear. I couldn't keep it on my finger,
                            so I had it fastened to my watch fob. The Ordinary Seaman assisting me
                            from up on deck was a brand-new guy on the ship. I called for some more
                            paint, and lowering it down, he had a loop that I apparently had my feet
                            caught in. Now that was my mistake. I shouldn't have had my feet in that
                            loop, but he tipped me right off that scaffold into the water. </p>

                        <p>We were anchored out from the shore that day, and there was a gangway
                            (kind of a stairway) let down from the side of the ship to bring pilots
                            and customs and such officials on board. I was probably one hundred feet
                            from that gangway when I hit the water, and I knew there were sharks in
                            the bay, so I swam for my life over there. I didn't see a shark, but I
                            heard him and I didn't stop to look! I climbed out onto that gangway
                            very thankful that I hadn't been chewed up at all, but minus my watch
                            and my ring.</p>

                        <p>We were out in the middle of the Caribbean in some pretty rough weather
                            and we saw this navy PBY airplane (an amphibious airplane) on the water.
                            So with all due speed (we asked the chief engineer to screw down the
                            safety valve) we turned tail and went away. Our instructions in those
                            days were to avoid all contact with everything; flee from it. Well, can
                            you imagine fleeing from anything in a six-knot ship? There was no way
                            we could get away from him. That PBY revved up its engines and went
                            after us and finally got within hailing distance. We want you to follow
                            us. There are some survivors in the water over there; we want you to
                            pick them up. We've got all that we can carry. They had taken on board
                            the worst of the survivors, those that were most in peril, and wanted us
                            to pick up the rest. So he took off and circled over these survivors;
                            and flew around to watch for submarines. </p>

                        <p>There were about forty men in the water. They had survived for three days
                            on coconuts. Their ship had been carrying coconuts back to England as
                            one part of their cargo. These men were cracking coconuts and drinking
                            the juice. That is how they survived for those three days before we
                            picked them up. They saved nothing off the ship; not even a lifeboat or
                            a life raft. But the coconuts floated. </p>

                        <p>There was a school of porpoises that stayed with them for the three days.
                            There must have been a good shoal of them; forty or fifty. Where
                            porpoises are, sharks wont go and barracuda wont go. </p>

                        <p>We arrived and spread some oil on the water to smooth the swells. We
                            launched two of our lifeboats and volunteers were called for; six
                            oarsmen and a coxsun and a helmsman for each. I rowed stroke oar. We
                            lowered away and rowed towards the survivors. We could see the school of
                            porpoise circling around the seamen in the water, but as we started to
                            pick up the survivors, the porpoise left. We didn't know it until later,
                            but those porpoise had been holding off a school of barracuda by
                            constantly circling between the men in the water and the sharks.</p>

                        <p>It took us about an hour and a half to round up all the survivors because
                            they were scattered over quite an area, and the sea was choppy. We
                            hadn't noticed it so much on the <i>Cacique</i>, but in those lifeboats
                            we <i>knew</i> it was choppy, and it was work. We managed to get most of
                            the men on board the lifeboats in our first load and headed back to the
                            ship, leaving two or three still in the water. By this time the porpoise
                            had left, and the barracuda moved in as soon as they left. By the time
                            we got back to those three, they were badly mangled by the barracuda. </p>

                        <p>But those British sailors! They thought the old tub we were sailing was
                            the <i>Queen Mary</i>, it was so comfortable and so spacious compared to
                            their ship. They didn't have a crew mess to eat in. Each of them carried
                            what you call a mess kit tied to his waist, and when it came time to eat
                            they filed past the galley, picked up their ration, took it to eat
                            wherever they could find a place to sit. They were sleeping eight or ten
                            men in a little cabin which we would only put three in. No fresh water
                            for showers or anything like that. Even on this old <i>Cacique</i> we
                            had fresh-water showers. So they thought our <i>Cacique</i> was pretty
                            wonderful. They could hardly believe the accommodations we had. We
                            didn't have beds for them all; but we found beds for those that were
                            most severely injured. </p>

                        <p>We were a good twelve hours away from Kingston, Jamaica. We altered our
                            course and put in and put the survivors ashore, and those three men into
                            hospital. Those three men lived as long as they were on board, but I
                            don't know how they made out ashore. They were in very, very critical
                            condition by the time we got them to Kingston. We would have picked up
                            survivors regardless of nationality, even if German. But these we would
                            never have seen because they were 10 miles off our course. Whether or
                            not that PBY would have stood by if they'd been Germans, I don't know.
                            It was a Coast Guard plane.</p>

                        <p>Once (in the <i>Cacique</i> that was) down somewhere around Florida, we
                            encountered a scrap between a destroyer and a submarine where the
                            submarine lost. We were three ships in convoy with two escorts. Suddenly
                            the escorts went crazy, chasing round and round in circles and dropping
                            depth charges. The destroyers were operating in pretty tight quarters.
                            We were pretty close in to the beach with land only a mile or two to
                            starboard. Pieces of the sub came up to the surface. </p>

                        <h2>The Moremactide</h2>
                        <h3>Jail in Buenos Aires</h3>

                        <p>And then on the strength of being fired from ESSO, the National Maritime
                            Union, looking for members, gave me a membership card. So I went union
                            and got a job with Moor McCormick, which was the company that had the
                            first ship I was on. I signed on as an Ordinary Seaman and got a
                            freighter to South America called <i>Moremactide</i>. </p>

                        <p>She had a cage built out on the stern, up on top of the poop deck, for a
                            polar bear who was being transported down to Buenos Aires. And it turned
                            out to be my duty to wash that cage out and feed that bear and to hose
                            him down now and then. That was a job I was very careful about. I didn't
                            get too close to that cage. I stuck the meat in on the end of a kind of
                            a fork so that if anything was taken, it was the fork and not me. Was
                            that bear ever glad to get off the ship in Buenos Aires! </p>

                        <p>It was on that ship that we stopped at Santos. For diversion on our
                            liberty, another seaman and I took a trolley down to the Santos beach.
                            We met a Russian family at the beach and he invited us to his home in
                            Sao Paulo. He had a beautiful daughter, which was the attraction to the
                            family. He chaperoned us all around Santos, and sent a chaperone with us
                            to see the museums and the parks and what have you, and gave us a great
                            time. We got back to the ship and went to Buenos Aires and it was there
                            that I met a seaman on a Norwegian ship that had been on the
                                <i>Barstow</i> with me. </p>

                        <p>He was a Swede from Minnesota and when he was paid off the <i>Barstow</i>
                            he signed on this Norwegian ship. Now the guys on this Norwegian ship
                            didn't have any cigarettes. We were rationed cigarettes in those days. I
                            could get two cartons a week, and I had six or seven cartons because I
                            wasn't smoking. I took a couple of cartons and was going over to his
                            ship to give them to him. Now the docks in Buenos Aires are enclosed in
                            a high barbed wire fence and the customs are at the gate, but there are
                            apparently customs officers inside roaming around, because one of them
                            saw me with these cigarettes. He didn't believe me when I told him where
                            I was going, and I ended up in the Buenos Aires jail. Well I was there
                            for nearly a week until they bailed me out to go home. And I guess there
                            was a fine to pay which was taken out of my pay when I got home.</p>

                        <p>I can remember going into Buenos Aires on the <i>Brazil</i> and on the
                                <i>Moremactide</i>. We had to enter the Montevideo harbor first and
                            we could see the remains of the <i>Grafspee</i> (a German battleship
                            which was sunk in the harbor) there. Actually that was about the same
                            time that our brothers and sisters were traveling on the <i>Star</i>
                            line into Buenos Aires. We may have even crossed paths there, but it
                            wasn't until years later that I learned about them.</p>

                        <h2>Men I remember from Sea</h2>

                        <p>I had some pretty good friends. I haven't kept contact with them though.
                            Once you take your oar and plant it ashore, why, you don't see too many
                            of them. Some very good skippers I thought an awful lot of and I would
                            sail with again. I had had some awful good friends that took care of me
                            and kind of kept me out of mischief. Then there were a lot of friends
                            that were bound to get you into mischief. </p>

                        <p>I sailed with one chief engineer twice. He was on the Stephen Beasley and
                            also on the Eastpoint Victory. That was Ira Seager. He had HUGE hands.
                            Mom says you about lost your hand when he shook hands with you. He was
                            nice. He told me what to stay off and how to stay out of trouble. Most
                            of my friends from these days were from New York City, but Ira was from
                            the country; from Ithaca where Mom went to college.</p>

                        <p>Then there was Harold Fretts. He was a Booth Bay Harbor boy. He was
                            sicker than a dog every trip and was always sure he was never going to
                            go to sea again. But he couldn't stay away. On our 2<sup>nd</sup>
                            honeymoon trip, we were heading up to visit him when the car quit in
                            Algonquet.</p>

                        <p>*And Smitty who came to our wedding, but got there too late and Grammy
                            had to entertain him. He called us up in our hotel room. He was studying
                            to be an officer in the Navy school.</p>

                        <p>I had a good friend from Saugerties who was torpedoed three times, Dean
                            VanEtten. He was on the Murmansk run, way up north around Norway and
                            Finland, where the German submarines were blockading Russia. Mom went to
                            school and girl scouts with his wife, Kate. I think they lived in Lake
                            Katrine, just north of Kingston NY.</p>

                        <p>Lyle Imler was purser on the Ignatious Donnelly. Mom remembers going to a
                            party at his house which turned her off drinking. He lived out on Long
                            Island somewhere.</p>

                        <p>Paddy who helped me out on the Brazil, and was a bosun at Fort Trumbull
                            was a city boy, from New York City maybe.</p>

                        <p>A merchant crew would be about 33 men. We had a gun crew on board of
                            probably 18 men, who were Navy people. Sometimes there was friction
                            between us and the Navy; sometimes not. Being on a ship <i>is</i> a
                            community; but a forced community. And your ships; I must have been on
                            fifteen or twenty ships throughout the years I sailed, but every ones
                            different. Some ships you get along fine. Other ships theres no way you
                            can do it. So if you get a good ship, you stick her out for two trips.
                            If you got a poor ship, you got off the first chance you got.</p>

                        <p>In most American ships, there were 3 to 4 foot alleyways between the crew
                            bunks. Then at the foot of the bunk was a lockable cabinet. Each room
                            had 4 guys and the bunks were built so ou were first on your head, then
                            on your feet when the ship rolled, rather uncomfortable. When I became
                            an officer, I had my own cabin. It had a built in bed that was fore and
                            aft, so it went with the roll. I would often sling a hammock in bad
                            weather, that was much better than the beds.</p>

                        <p>Did you know the origin of the word Posh? There was a shipping line out
                            of Britain to the Far East; India etc. They had a monopoly on the Far
                            East trade. The English passengers always liked to reserve cabins on the
                            shady side of the ship; Port Out, Starboard Home. Take the first letter
                            of each word and there you have how the word got started!</p>

                        <h2>The Ocean: One of God's Wonders</h2>

                        <p>So far I haven't told you what there was about the sea that I loved so
                            much. The sea is one of God's wonders, and it has so many moods moods of
                            deep peace, moods of turbulence, mighty storms, moods of great beauty.
                            And I enjoyed every bit of that the glorious sunrises and sunsets which
                            are unequaled on land. The sea itself had so many faces; calm, choppy,
                            full of waves. There were the fish that you could see the porpoises that
                            ran with the ships, playing back and forth across the bow, jumping in
                            the bow wave; whales that you could see from a distance; the sea birds,
                            sea gulls. You always could tell when you were getting close to land
                            because you would start to see sea gulls. In the South Pacific we saw
                            the albatross, masters of the air and masters of the sea. In tropical
                            waters you could look down and see the barnacles on the hull underwater.
                            You could always find something of eternity in the sea, even in the
                            storms which caused you all kinds of trouble, work and fear.</p>

                        <p>But the other side of the sea was the crews, and each ship was different.
                            Some ships were good but most of them were terrible, like that head
                            waiter who led me astray on the <i>Brazil.</i> Seamen would for
                            jealousys sake climb on your back on their way up. There were all kinds
                            of foul, foul language, and foul, foul deeds, and very few morals or
                            scruples. So I soon decided that the sea was not for me for life. I
                            couldn't see myself existing with that kind of a life, even though I
                            loved the ocean itself. However, because of the war I had to remain at
                            sea until they let me go about a year after the war was over.</p>

                        <h2>Round the World</h2>
                        <h3>To the Persian Gulf and Home Again</h3>

                        <p>One of my more memorable trips was the Persian Gulf trip we made around
                            the world with a load of four diesel locomotives on deck we were taking
                            them to Russia. They were being shipped to Russia as part of the
                            Lend-Lease agreement. Because the authorities figured the Atlantic
                            crossing was too risky, we were directed to go the other way: through
                            the Panama Canal, across the Pacific, below India, and up into the
                            Gulf.</p>

                        <p>We left New York and sailed down the coast to the Delaware Bay. We went
                            up the Delaware Bay to Philly and loaded out of there. Since we were at
                            war, we used the inland passageway. Between the Delaware and the
                            Chesapeake theres a canal, so we didn't get out to sea there at the
                            Delaware, but once we got down the Chesapeake, why we were out on the
                            ocean. </p>

                        <p>Now while we were loading those locomotives, we were going to be in this
                            port for some time, so I got a couple days of shore leave and I caught a
                            train up to Ithaca where Laurel was so I could to spend my last shore
                            liberty I could have with her. I got there and lo and behold, she was on
                            points. This wonderful institution of Cornell had penalized her for one
                            thing or another, and said she had to be in by 9:00 p.m. And here we
                            were engaged, and I couldn't see her after 9 o'clock! Well, I lost a bit
                            of respect for Cornell that trip!</p>

                        <p>But anyhow, to get on with the story: we got this ship loaded and sailed
                            her down the Chesapeake on a bleak winter day in ice and snow, and
                            headed for the Panama Canal. As we steamed down along the east coast, we
                            could see the hulks of several torpedoed ships along the beaches. We
                            weren't running very far off the beach ourselves. There were four of us
                            ships on that trip. We were convoying down to the Panama Canal; the four
                            ships and one destroyer. We had a triple expansion engine and the # 1
                            bearing melted out. We had to do an emergency repair, out of the convoy.
                            A destroyer escort stayed with us and we weren't attacked, but they
                            turned us loose after we got through the Canal.</p>

                        <p>You weren't safe when convoying. The escorts were supposed to protect
                            you, not to stop and pick up torpedoed people; there was no stopping for
                            these. Radar scanned the surface, and sonar under water. The escorts all
                            had sonar. But if a submarine was drifting or had stopped its pumps, it
                            could not be heard, and their periscopes were too small to be
                            visible.</p>

                        <p>Some place off the Florida Keys we watched an airplane sink a submarine
                            that was attacking our convoy. They dropped bombs which got it to the
                            surface where it broke in half. I feel for those guys on that sub. You
                            have no chance on a sub. On ships you sometimes have a chance.</p>

                        <p>But back to this trip. We made it to the Panama Canal all right, and I
                            experienced going through the Canal, smelling all the lovely flowers (I
                            wish I could remember their names). As we went along; the place was just
                            one floral bouquet after another. And we experienced going up and down
                            the locks. We were four ships that left Philadelphia at the same time,
                            and we were convoyed down the east coast and through the Canal. </p>

                        <p>But once we got through the Canal, we were on our own (still sailing in
                            convoy, but with no escorts). We sailed across the Pacific; a nice,
                            quiet, peaceful sail. Each of our ships were carrying four locomotive
                            engines on deck. We had two 75-ton cranes especially installed on the
                            ship to handle the engines. It would roll the ship when they moved those
                            engines. </p>

                        <p>We went south of New Zealand and Australia, and got driven from the 40
                            degrees latitude, which we called the Roaring 40's (and they were!) down
                            to 60 degrees south. The waves got to be longer and longer between them,
                            and the captain was afraid to turn the ship, which was 300 feet long and
                            carrying these four electric diesel locomotives on deck. The 40's are
                            called the Roaring 40's, the 50's the Howling 50's, and the 60's the
                            Screaming 60's. </p>

                        <p>We got driven from 40 degree latitude down to 60 degrees south. That was
                            pretty awesome: a mile between the crests of the waves. The ship would
                            dip down and you could sit in the crow's nest, which was ninety feet
                            above the water, look up at a pretty steep angle to see the next wave.
                            And that was where I learned to love albatross. When you were 90 feet up
                            in the crows nest, they were always there. The crows nest would swing in
                            30 to 40 foot arcs from the ships rolling, 45 degrees to port and
                            starboard. He would be out there, twenty feet from you, following the
                            roll of the mast with never a flap or quiver of their wings; just
                            floating along. I could only see its wing tip feathers ruffle a bit. I
                            can only describe it as floating. Not flying, but floating. Albatross
                            are huge, with a wingspan of about 12 feet, and he would just follow you
                            back and forth, never landing. I don't know how they rest. I saw one
                            take off once. They'd ride up the crest and as they hit the crest and
                            the wind up there, they'd flap their feet a couple of times and be
                            airborne. It was really a sight. Then they had to coast down the hill
                            before they got up speed enough to get up. </p>

                        <p>The sailors all loved the albatross, at least the wooden ship sailors
                            did. The seagulls are plentiful in harbors, and they will follow a ship
                            for a while out to sea, but then they'll fly home. Seagulls will also
                            eat litter from off the water. Well, I never saw an albatross do that.
                            But when you are in the southern hemisphere, an albatross will leave
                            port with you, then follow you for weeks. They will dive down to a
                            cresting wave and pick up krill and other sea life with its beak. I
                            don't know what the attraction was except that they were beautiful
                            birds, masters of the air. Sometimes below 40 degrees south, the Kestrel
                            would follow us too. </p>

                        <p>Our ship was rolling from one side to the other at a 45 degree angle,
                            which left the life rafts tipped way out over the water. They usually
                            just lean up against the shrouds, but we lashed ours (tied them onto the
                            ship). This is unwise in war time when you don't know when you'll be
                            torpedoed. But we figured it was better to <i>have</i> them. On our ship
                            we managed to keep all of our life rafts, but some of the other three
                            ships lost theirs overboard. </p>

                        <p>We were running with no lights, because it was wartime and blackout. One
                            night a light came on up on the foredeck, ahead of those locomotives,
                            and there was no way for us to get it out, somehow or other the switches
                            weren't working. So I volunteered to go put it out. The waves were so
                            high that the ship was taking water with each big wave that hit her the
                            waves would wash right over the deck. So I made myself a harness (a
                            lifeline, you call it) and tied myself up in it. Someone paid the line
                            out and held on to the other end, and I fought my way forward to this
                            light, unscrewed it and came on back, hanging on tight every time a wave
                            washed over the ship, so as not to be washed overboard. </p>

                        <p>The four ships, carrying the sixteen locomotives all traveled the same
                            route. One ship lost a locomotive overboard, it was rolling so much.
                            When it went overboard, all it took was the railing with it, and the
                            hull weld held at the deck line. If it had been a riveted ship, it
                            wouldn't have held. Liberties were welded. They still use it as an
                            engineering mistake taught in England. </p>

                        <p>*Dad had the job of checking the turnbuckles that bolted the locomotives
                            to the deck; he did it every day to make sure they didn't loosen.</p>

                        <p>The captain was afraid to turn the ship, which was 300 feet long and
                            carrying these 4 electric diesel locomotives on the deck. If it turned
                            and wasn't right, the whole ship would capsize. We were running a 45
                            degree angle to the waves, going southwest. We needed to turn ninety
                            degrees and head northwest because we had already been blown way out of
                            our route, far south of Australia. You don't go head on into such seas
                            because there's a tremendous direct drop of the bow, and the propeller
                            comes out of the water and you are in danger of losing propeller and
                            all. The rolling was bad enough at a 45 degree angle to the waves. So
                            it's a matter of seamanship; you watch the waves and choose one you
                            think you can get turned on in the mile between crests. Before we drove
                            into the ice, the captain did turn it, and made it. We made it up to
                            Perth, which is on the southwest corner of Australia. I was an AB on
                            that ship.</p>

                        <p>And there I had an interesting experience. We were supposed to spend four
                            days in Perth while they refitted some of the ships that had lost their
                            life rafts overboard, and spruced them up from the locomotives going
                            overboard. I got an early liberty and went ashore with two or three of
                            my shipmates. We actually were docked at Freemantle, and Perth was an
                            hour or more away by bus or train. We were roaming the streets of Perth
                            when a bobby came up to me and he said, &quot;Are you Paul Arnold?&quot;
                            And I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; And he said, &quot;Ive got news for you.
                            Your ship is sailing in 2 hours. The crew had to get back to our ship
                            right away because she had gotten orders to sail instead of waiting for
                            the others. We hadn't been in Perth more than an hour. The interesting
                            thing was, he picked me out because I had a beard which was blond and a
                            bit red. That's the way he picked me out of the entire population of the
                            city of Perth! The Merchant Services had arranged for our repairs, but
                            the Navy said, You're not getting them.</p>

                        <p>From Perth we went up through the Indian Ocean. We experienced a typhoon.
                            Well, we made it to the Persian Gulf and we anchored in the Gulf in the
                            mouth of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. There was a real current
                            there, and it was hot as hot as can be. We were low on bunkers. Bunkers
                            is the oil that the ship burned to get their power and make the
                            Propellers go. They sent us up the river to Baden to get our bunkers
                            Filled up. After that we went back out to the Gulf and lay there in the
                            mouth of the Tigris/Euphrates for two months, waiting to unload. They
                            only had two docks there, and there were about 20 ships waiting to get
                            in. And you were unloaded in order of your arrival. </p>

                        <p>The dock had been destroyed somehow, and the ship bringing decking in was
                            torpedoed. So they confiscated a load of rosewood logs that were 6 thick
                            and 12 long to use for decking. I bartered for a log and carved that
                            Cowboy boot for Mom from it. I lashed the log on deck someplace, I
                            think, and sold the remainder for a pretty penny. </p>

                        <p>It was so hot, the hottest place I've ever been; 130&#730; to 140&#730;
                            and no shade. We just found a shady place and hung out. We couldn't go
                            Swimming because of the terrifically fast current. One guy fell
                            overboard (I don't know if he really fell overboard, or thought he would
                            go for a swim) but we nearly lost him because we couldn't get a lifeboat
                            out quick enough. We had to drop the life boat off the davits with a
                            crew and row after him. It took a heck of a row to get back, it was a
                            mile an hour current. We were lucky, though, and managed to catch up to
                            him.</p>

                        <p>On our ship we decided it was too hot to work our standard shore watches.
                            The sea watches run 4:00 to 8:00, 8:00 to 12:00, and 12:00 to 4:00. But
                            in harbor, the sea watches usually broke down, and the crew did an
                            8-hour shift from 8:00 in the morning until 5:00 at night with an hour
                            out for lunch. But it was too hot to work during the day, so we decided
                            we would go to work at 4:00 in the morning. We'd turn the ship lights on
                            (Our Navy was controlling the Gulf, so there weren't any submarines and
                            we were safe.) and we'd do our chipping and our painting and our
                            scraping, and then at 8:00 in the morning, we'd quit and go find us the
                            shadiest spot we could, and try to stay cool. </p>

                        <p>The decks were so hot that in your ordinary shoes (sneakers) you burned
                            your feet. I braided myself rope sandals to be able to walk on the deck.
                            In fact, some of us tried cooking an egg on the deck. It wouldn't
                                <i>fry</i>, but it did cook! It took a little while, but it cooked
                            the eggs enough so they were edible on the deck!</p>

                        <p>It was a crazy ship. The captain didn't like rats. He would take his 22
                            down in the hold and shoot rats. You can imagine what that sounded like,
                            in a metal-hulled ship!</p>

                        <p>It was in the Persian Gulf I lost my glasses overboard. I still had to
                            stand look out from the crows nest in the Gulf and all the way home. The
                            mate knew 15 20 minutes about anything before I saw it. (After that I
                            always carried two sets of glasses.) </p>

                        <p>When I was on the <i>ESSO Augusta</i>, where we had the diesel engines
                            below us and the boilers above us, we had a Steward who was too stingy
                            to run the ships beautiful air conditioning system. But this Steward was
                            good enough to let us put our mattresses out on the deck and we slept
                            out there at night. I never saw a drop of rain throughout our time
                            there. </p>

                        <p>On the side, though, our Steward was looking for a fast dollar. The ships
                            all had a slop chest (the store of clothing and personal supplies such
                            as tobacco carried on merchant ships for the crew). What the sailors
                            used was deducted from their wages. Anyhow this steward was kind of
                            greety, and he sold a good deal of our ships linens overboard; the slop
                            chest clothing, and a good deal of our stores over the side (on the
                            black market). He sold most of our food as well, thinking that we would
                            put in at Cape Town three weeks out of the Persian Gulf and could
                            re-provision there. He figured that he could sell it at high black
                            market prices there in the Gulf, and then use part of the money from
                            those sales to restock the supplies at lower prices when we stopped at
                            Cape Town, South Africa, on the way home. That way no one would miss
                            anything, and he'd have a nice little sum still, stashed away for
                            himself.</p>

                        <p>But things didn't turn out the way he'd planned. The Navy wouldn't let us
                            go to Cape Town. We went 300 miles south of the Cape of Good Home (to
                            about 45 degrees) and straight on across the South Atlantic to Bahia,
                            Brazil. So we ate white polished rice and kidney beans and coffee while
                            it lasted from the Persian Gulf to Bahia Brazil which is probably 47
                            days. </p>

                        <p>As I remember it, we had no spare clothing at all, only what we had on
                            our backs. So by the time we docked in New York, our clothes were pretty
                            ragged. But I think the food upset us more; living on white rice, kidney
                            beans, and an ersatz kind of tea the whole way. So we lost our
                            friendship for that steward! </p>

                        <p>On shore liberty in Bahia, I was hungry for one thing ice-cream. So I
                            went ashore into a drug store and ordered a quart of ice cream, ate it
                            up, and asked for another one, and ate that one too. The waitress
                            thought I was crazy! I wasn't 20 yet. </p>

                        <p>Anyhow; we picked up a convoy there at Bahia and made it home to New
                            York. The captain must have turned the steward in, (the radio man
                            couldn't have done it without the captain's permission), and when the
                            coast guard brought the New York harbor pilot out, they took the steward
                            off the ship. You see, the captain knew there was trouble with the crew.
                            If the crew had gotten hold of that steward, why! It was a good thing;
                            it saved the crew from being responsible for murder.</p>

                        <p>I knew Laurel from high school days. My sisters were instrumental in
                            that. They were in 4H and anyhow, they had a part in getting me tangled
                            up with her somehow. It was after I started going t osea that we wrote a
                            little bit but not too much, and the letters weren't all that good, but
                            somehow the relationship developed. </p>

                        <p>Laurel was still at Cornell in Ithaca and I somehow got word to her that
                            we were coming into New York. So she took a train to New York, and got
                            herself all dolled up on the train, and got off to meet me at Penn
                            Station, dressed to the nines. I was waiting for her on the platform,
                            but I never saw her; and it was a long time before she saw me. I was
                            standing on top of a pedestal peering about, looking for her in the
                            crowds of people on the platform (I couldn't see too good without my
                            glasses). She finally saw me. (You were a ragamuffin guy; your glasses
                            broken and no new clothes in a 9 month trip.) I had no shoes, my jeans
                            were a bunch of rags; and there she was, all decked out in her finest! </p>

                        <p>The first thing we did was get paid off at the ship and buy me a complete
                            outfit; suit, shoes, I may have even bought a tie I'm sure I would have!
                            I bought the first suit I saw; it shocked her a bit, but she got over
                            it!</p>

                        <p>This Round the World trip was miserable crew-wise. It was 9 months long
                            with 2 months in the Persian Gulf, with no shore leave. It made me
                            decide to go to officer school. As an officer, the sea became tolerable.

                        <h2>And So We Were Married</h2>

                        <p>I was paid off that ship with a good healthy paycheck, which we put in
                            the bank for college. But Mom had had enough, and that trip had such a
                            miserable crew that I decided I had to get off the deck and into the
                            cabin with the officers. So I volunteered to the Coast Guard for officer
                            training. I was accepted and sent to Fort Trumbull in New London, CT,
                            where I stayed for the next four months.</p>

                        <p>The sailor who helped me on the Brazil, Paddy, was bosun at Fort
                            Trumbull. When I went for officers school, we got reunited after four
                            years of not seeing each other.</p>

                        <p>When it came time for me to go to officers school, Laurel and I decided
                            we would get married, but we were going to wait until the war was over;
                            at least that was what I thought.</p>

                        <p>But because I wasn't at sea, I was suddenly called up by the draft board
                            back in Yellow Springs Ohio. I had made the mistake of not telling my
                            draft board that I would be continuing at sea. They got wind that I
                            wasn't at sea, and they summoned me. I thought I was going to be shipped
                            straight off to war. So I called Laurel and said, &quot;Look it, can we
                            push it up and get married right away?&quot; I packed my bags and was
                            ready to go out to Ohio where my draft board was. </p>

                        <p>But the Fort Trumbull Commandant saved us. He said, &quot;Nothing doing;
                            you are staying right here.&quot; So he squared it with the draft board,
                            and I stayed to finish my officers training. After I graduated from Fort
                            Trumbull as a merchant marine officer, a navy recruiter officer was
                            there and wanted me to sign up. They wouldn't take me when I had wanted
                            to, but after I got an officers training, I was worth something to them.
                            I told them no thanks.</p>

                        <p>We were married February 19, 1944, just before the end of my training.
                            Paddy came to our wedding in the Dutch Reform Church in New Paltz. I
                            went back and took some more tests and graduated as a merchant marine
                            officer. That's the last Ive seen of Paddy. Laurel and Papa came down
                            and I packed my bags and left Fort Trumbull and we went on a two week
                            honeymoon at Traitor Hill, near Albany, with two Great Danes. Laurel had
                            some relatives there who owned both the place and the dogs, and let us
                            stay there while they were on holiday in Florida. All we had to do was
                            take care of the dogs. </p>

                        <p>Anyhow, it was time to go back to sea, so we went back down to New York
                            and we got an apartment way up by the Bronx Zoo. The first night the man
                            who was bringing our furniture down couldn't make it for some reason or
                            other, so we slept in the bare apartment. We had my overcoat, we had a
                            couple of toothbrushes, and we bought a box of shredded wheat and a
                            quart of milk and ate our breakfast with the toothbrushes for spoons. He
                            finally showed up with our furniture about noon the next day, and we
                            moved in. </p>

                        <p>I thought I could get a job without going back to sea. My company that I
                            was going to sail with needed a night mate on a ship; now that's a ship
                            that's in dock. They have to have an officer on board who is responsible
                            for the ship. It was up near the George Washington Bridge. Mom had a job
                            teaching nursery school down in a day care center in lower Manhattan,
                            between the Williamsburg Bridge and the Brooklyn Bridge. She commuted to
                            that. So just about the time I got home from my night watch in the
                            morning, she left the house to get to work at 8:00, (she had an hour and
                            a half subway ride). And then she got home about the time I was leaving
                            for my night watch. We never really saw each other. </p>

                        <p>After about a month of that, we decided that this was no better than my
                            being at sea, so I went back to the shipping company and told them I
                            wanted to go back to sea. I don't want a night mates job anymore. I was
                            put on a ship called Ignatius Donnelley, which headed across the
                            Atlantic Ocean in convoy. </p>
                    </section>
                    <section>
                        <h2>The Ignatius Donnelley</h2>
                        <h3>Glasgow, the Buoy in the Wash, D-Day</h3>

                        <p>It was March, and the North Atlantic is bad in winter. That was the worse
                            crossing I ever had of the North Atlantic of the many that I had made.
                            We had a souwester and we were traveling northeast, so the wind and seas
                            were coming on our starboard quarter and the ship was rolling into them.
                            The storm was so bad our convoy of 100 ships was told to disburse. We
                            carried our lifeboats outboard, ordinarily, ready to drop in an
                            emergency. There were four on each liberty ship. It got so bad that we
                            pulled them in, and chocked them in their chocks on ship and lashed them
                            down. But the seas were running so high anyhow, each time we rolled into
                            a trough, they would take a pounding. First they bashed in our #3
                            lifeboat, then our #1 and even #4. Even the bridge, 10 feet higher than
                            the lifeboats was taking a pounding and we had to keep the starboard
                            door to the bridge closed to keep the water out of it. It was a
                            combination of very high, steep waves and terrible rolling. You'd roll
                            and a wave would come and pound you, and basically knock the lifeboat
                            right out of its davits. I pulled the last lifeboat back into its
                            cradle, chocked it and tied it in. I managed to save it, but it still
                            got damaged and wouldn't have been seaworthy. So when we finally got
                            into the Irish Sea, our ship was sent for repairs to the firth that
                            Glasgow was on. We anchored at Greenock, and repairs were made to our
                            lifeboats. We had also lost all seven of our life rafts over the side
                            too, and those were replaced. They leaned up against the mast on the
                            stays. </p>

                        <p>Glasgow was one of the warmest ports Ive ever been in; I guess its my
                            favorite of all the ports I was in. It was one port I got into where we
                            were taken into a home and treated like sons. The Third Assistant
                            Engineer, Rodney Martin, and I were buddies by this time and we were
                            given liberty that night. We decided wed go up to a hotel and book in
                            and get a bath. On the way out we were going to look for a movie or
                            something to do. The girl at the desk said to us, &quot;What are you
                            doing tonight?&quot; And we said, &quot;Well, we're looking around
                            town.&quot; She said, &quot;Why don't you come home with me tonight.
                            We're having a party and the people that we were expecting aren't able
                            to come. We'd love to have you.&quot; So we did. We went with her to her
                            home, and it turned out to be one of the best things that happened to
                            us. The months we were in that port, we were in that home every minute
                            we could. Glasgow turned out to be a very wonderful place in spite of
                            the fact that it was one of the most dismal looking towns I have ever
                            seen; gray, smoggy and smoky. But we had a wonderful time in that
                            family. They took us in and treated us like sons. As a matter of fact,
                            the third engineer, married Jesse, their daughter (the receptionist at
                            the desk). After the war was over and I was up at Oswego going to
                            school, we got this telegram from Rodney saying would I come and be his
                            best man? He was a Hoosier boy from Indiana, so we drove out with Lynn
                            in a basinet in the back seat and I stood up for him.</p>

                        <p>Mom says Dad would have married Jessie himself, but he was married to me.
                            She was a nice girl!</p>

                        <p>There is another story about my time on that ship. We got refurbished
                            there in the dock yards in the Clyde. They came out in barges to work on
                            us; get our rigging put back together and our lifeboats on them. During
                            the War, we ran on double daylight savings time. We went up around the
                            Northern tip of Scotland in convoy and we could read the newspaper at
                            midnight without any lights out on deck, it was so far north and close
                            to the Arctic Circle. We went up between the Outer Hebrides and Skye,
                            through The Minch, and through Scapa Flow between the Orkneys and
                            Scotland.</p>

                        <p>We got down to Hull, and there we discharged our war cargo. Then moved to
                            Grimsby where she was put into dry-dock to be fitted out as a troop
                            ship. I bought myself a sextant there and enjoyed England. It was
                            beautiful. It was the month of May by that time and the place was as
                            green as green could be and the blossoms were all out. Oh, it was just a
                            gorgeous place; although the country was in a state of war, still it was
                            beautiful. </p>

                        <p>This was in 1944, and we were being refitted in preparation for the
                            Normandy Invasion, though we didn't know it at the time. Once the
                            Ignatius Donnelly had been made over from a freighter to a troop ship
                            that could carry 2000 men, they sent us down to Tillsbury docks in
                            London. </p>

                        <p>We were running down the coast in a two-lane convoy, because we were in a
                            channel swept by mine sweepers. We were coming light. A Liberty ships
                            light; she draws about 18 feet aft and about 6 feet forward and is very
                            easily affected by the wind. If the winds sideways shell go like a crab
                            down through the water. I was the second ship in the starboard column
                            and I was on watch when we came to what they call the Bight; the corner
                            where England starts to jut out to the East toward Europe. They also
                            have another name for it, the Wash. There is a tremendous tide there;
                            the Wash comes out at a good clip. This was my first trip as an officer.
                            I was the second ship in line, relieving the chief mate; I was third
                            mate, 8:00 - 12:00 watch (over supper) and the officers were all down in
                            the boardroom playing poker. I saw this buoy ahead in the middle of the
                            channel. I saw the ship ahead of me having trouble getting around it, so
                            I started giving her leeway, and I didn't give it enough. </p>

                        <p>I got the buoy midship on the port side, and the buoy was perhaps twenty
                            feet in diameter. That buoy bounced the whole rest of the way down the
                            ships side! It made quite a racket as she bounced along the side of the
                            hull. The ship was empty and it sounded like a drum: <i>Boing! Boing!
                                Boing!</i> All the engine room crew bailed out of the engine room
                            and left the engineer there to answer my telegraph signals to stop the
                            engine by the time the propeller was near this buoy. Well, I gave the
                            ship hard left rudder and called for full speed ahead for about 40
                            revolutions to get the stern swinging out away from the buoy. And then I
                            cut the engines so that the buoy wouldn't clean up the propeller. </p>

                        <p>Anyhow, the chief mate came up (I was the third mate, the lowest mate on
                            the ship) and started giving me a dressing down. They were afraid we'd
                            been torpedoed or hit something pretty heavy. The captain had come up
                            from his poker game in the ward room. </p>

                        <p>He pushed the Mate aside and says, &quot;Mr.. Arnold, did you stop your
                            engines when you went by that buoy?&quot; </p>

                        <p>I said, &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; </p>

                        <p>He says, &quot;That's good. And he turned around and went back to his
                            poker game and left me alone. That took the wind out of the chief mates
                            sails and he went back to the poker game too. It went on record around
                            there. I was the man who hit the buoy in The Wash and the pilots that
                            took us across the Channel for D-Day all knew it, and I heard about it
                            quite often. We had to have an English pilot between London and
                            Normandy, going down the Channel. One of them told us that American
                            sailors (like me) had taken out more buoys than you could shake a stick
                            at, and the Brits couldn't replace them. At least I didn't damage my
                            buoy nor the ship. It was on this ship, while we were taking troops,
                            that I beat the champion cribbage player of the British Pilot
                            Association.</p>

                        <p>The Old Man on the Ignatious Donnelley had been a captain on the Alaska
                            Inland Passage; some of the worst waters there are. Nothing phased him.
                            He is the one that told me never to play poker; I didn't have a poker
                            face. He had a hand on the crew and took care of trouble before it got
                            too far. I respected him a great deal.</p>

                        <p>On that trip down where I scraped the buoy, a German plane came over and
                            lined up on our rank of the convoy. You could see his bombs underneath
                            his wings. The first ship didn't open up on him; but our gunners were
                            out there and they opened fire on him and he unloaded his bombs on the
                            next ship, but missed them. That's the only time I was in active
                            combat.</p>

                        <p>In London, we pulled into the Tilbury Docks to await further orders.
                            Further orders were that we take soldiers for the Normandy invasion. So
                            I got into the Normandy Invasion on D-Day plus 1. We would load troops
                            on at Tillbury docks. They were on board for a night. We were locked
                            into the dock until the tide was right to get out of the docks. Then we
                            anchored out in the Thames for 38 or 40 hours to make up the convoy
                            before we sailed. We would run down through the Channel, *(around the
                            Isle of Wight?) and across to the Normandy beaches where wed get in as
                            close as we could before dropping off our men. There were small boats, a
                            lot of them fishing boats, that would take them in to shore from there.
                            Then wed turn around and head back to London for our next load. In all,
                            we made seven trips down through the English Channel to Normandy before
                            our ship was released. </p>

                        <p>The Allies had command of the air by then. But V1 buzz bombs were flying
                            in (attacking England). The twin engine Lighting's could tip them into
                            the ocean to stop them exploding in England, and the spitfires could
                            dive as fast. We saw this over the cliffs along the Channel. The V2 was
                            supersonic. You didn't know they were around until they hit. There was a
                            German scientist, Werner von Braun that was captured and brought to the
                            USA to help with our armaments. The nearest I experienced this part of
                            the war was the Normandy invasion, but by the time we were in there on
                            D+1, the Germans were driven so far back that they weren't able to
                            disturb the landing. Besides that, we had air cover all day long, so
                            none of the Nazi planes could fly over.</p>

                        <p>One funny little incident. We loaded a bunch of the Queens Own Cameron
                            Highlanders in Tillbury docks. For some reason or other that convoy was
                            delayed and we lay in anchor in Tillbury for two days. They had four
                            bagpipers on that ship. Even when you're in dock, you've got to stand
                            your watch and the mates got to be up there on the bridge. Being the
                            third mate, I was on the 8-12 watch and that was when those bagpipers
                            did their practicing. They got out underneath the bridge and walked up
                            the starboard side, across between number two hatch and three hatch,
                            back down on the port side and across right underneath the bridge,
                            playing those cussed bagpipes, stomp, stomp, stomp. And they did that
                            for two solid hours, these bagpipes screaming as loud as they could, and
                            all these Cameron Highlanders sitting around listening to them. I
                            couldn't get away from them because I was on the bridge and that was my
                            post of duty and I had to be there. I didn't appreciate them; I know I
                            should be getting my kilt out If they had played them out on the
                            afterdeck, it would have been all right; a little further away, you
                            know, and downwind! There were four of them in their kilts walking
                            along, a beautiful sight actually, but we didn't have ear muffs in those
                            days. They were on board for those two days in dock and then we sailed
                            and it was another day. So I listened to them for three days; was I ever
                            glad to unload that load!</p>

                        <p>In the early mornings and late afternoons flights of bombers would go
                            over these B-17, B-14's, Lancaster bombers fifty, a hundred, two hundred
                            bombers going over into Germany from England. They were demolishing
                            Germany at that point. From where we were anchored at the beach head,
                            there was the city of Caen, a fairly large French city back in from the
                            coast. And that was one of their targets. One night the whole sky was
                            red over that city.</p>

                        <p>D-Day was June 6, 1944. Mom was working in New York then, in the Lower
                            East Side and on D-day the churches all rang their bell steady from
                            morning until night. I wasn't quite sure what it was all about but it
                            just made my stomach knot. I had a feeling that was where Paul was, but
                            I didn't know it for weeks, or months maybe after. It was supposed to be
                            victorious and glad, this ringing of the church bells; but it just made
                            me scared to death.</p>

                        <p>With the Donnelly Paul made 7 round trips past the Seven Sisters in the
                            English Channel. We went almost to the Isle of Wight before turning
                            direct south to the Normandy beach America called Omaha. While going
                            past the Seven Sisters, I saw air-battles over them. The only plane we
                            had capable of catching a Buzz Bomb was the Lincoln. They'd catch up to
                            the Buzz bomb and come up under one of its wings and tip it up. That
                            would flip the Buzz bomb nose down into the sea where it exploded on
                            impact.</p>

                        <p>We didn't go into the Normandy beaches on D-Day, but arrived at the beach
                            the following day. We had about 300 men aboard. The Allies sunk a whole
                            pile of messed up and old ships in line like a long pier, to make a safe
                            zone for landing the troops. From the Isle of Wight we would angle in
                            past those sunken ships, and then let off the troops about mile off
                            shore. They would use landing nets and LST landing craft. We traveled in
                            convoys of 15 to 20 ships, unloaded ASAP to get back into the English
                            Channel. The Omaha beach was at Arromanches-les Bains. </p>

                        <p>Our ship ran seven trips into the British sector of the beach we were
                            carrying British troops. And each time wed run back up the coast of
                            England to pick up more troops, so before we finished our tour of duty,
                            I went past the Seven Sisters fourteen times in all, coming and going. I
                            well understand why Darvell enjoys those cliffs in their outings down
                            there, although at that time we had no idea that there was ever going to
                            be a Darvell.</p>

                        <p>All the time I was at sea, I never was torpedoed, but a good number of my
                            ships were torpedoed after I left them. I had a very close friend from
                            Saugerties who was torpedoed three times, Dick VanEtten.</p>

                        <p>Mom points out that I was just twenty one and I was an officer on these
                            huge ships responsible for navigation and all. The navigation actually
                            was later, and the tankers in those days weren't all that big; three
                            hundred feet long. The cargo ships weren't any bigger; ten thousand
                            tons. The Victory ships were twelve thousand tons.</p>

                        <p>There is one crossing of the Atlantic where I never got a sighting from
                            the time we left South Hampton, until we saw land; New Jersey. (Our
                            dictionary says that dead reckoning is the determination without the aid
                            of celestial observations of the position of a ship from the record of
                            the courses sailed, the distance made, and the known or estimated
                            drift.) On cloudy nights, when you can't take sightings on the stars,
                            you have to go by dead reckoning. You have charts of the ocean currents;
                            how fast they go in what direction. Then you measure how fast you are
                            going, and measure the wind reckoning how fast and from what angle. You
                            add and subtract all these together; I was here and Ive traveled so far,
                            and the current and winds are doing thus, so Im here! You always have
                            the ships log which keeps track of the course, wind, knots, etc. This
                            crossing l had to sail (must have navigation officer--2<sup>nd</sup>
                            mate?) across the Atlantic on dead reckoning. I got within 5 miles of my
                            destination, which was Barnegat Light House on the bottom end of Island
                            Beach, New Jersey; south of Sandy Hook. </p>

                        <h2>The Eastpoint Victory</h2>
                        <h3>Liederkranz, the Merry-Open-Bottom, and the End of the War</h3>

                        <p>When we got home from that trip, I caught another ship, the <i>Eastpoint
                                Victory</i>. All the ships I'd sailed up until then were ten- knot
                            liberty ships. The Persian Gulf trip and the <i>Ignatius Donnelley</i>
                            were liberty ships, and the <i>Barstow</i> was a tanker. The
                                <i>Cacique</i> was a little old tramp steamer, and the Banana boats
                            were passenger freighters combined. Our best run for one day in a
                            liberty ship would be 240 nautical miles. But the <i>Eastpoint
                                Victory</i> was a Victory ship, quite a different ship a steam
                            turbine. She had three times the power of the Liberties and was good for
                            eighteen knots. So I had to learn to navigate all over again because,
                            instead of 240 miles a day, we were making close to 400, and at that
                            speed you had to be a little better with your sextant. </p>

                        <p>About the time the war was over, Id earned my Second Mates license and
                            had become a navigating officer, responsible for loading and unloading
                            the ship and stowing the cargo and that kind of stuff, seeing to it that
                            the ship was in trim and all that. I was Second Mate, the navigating
                            officer, on that ship. That ship carried four mates, and the Chief Mate
                            had no watch. The Second Mate (that was me) did the Chief Mate's watch
                            and then it passed on that way. As soon as we caught the ship down in
                            Newport News and commissioned her, (it was her maiden voyage), we
                            brought her up to New York. </p>

                        <p>We were scheduled for a week in New York, which was great for me: I
                            immediately tried to get hold of Mom in the Bronx. But she was not in
                            the Bronx anymore: she had moved lock stock and barrel down to the lower
                            East side. So my ship was docked within a stone's throw of the apartment
                            she was in, and I didn't even know it! </p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, the Chief Mate, being the senior officer on deck outside of
                            the Captain, got first choice of liberty, and he quickly took it and
                            hopped the train and went to Boston. He hadn't any more than gotten on
                            the train when we got a change of orders to sail immediately for New
                            Orleans. So we had to sail without him.</p>

                        <p>In the meantime I had contacted Mom and got her to come down to the
                            docks, so at least I could talk with her before I had to sail. When she
                            heard about our sailing orders, she took a leave of absence (took sick
                            leave) from her job and caught a train to New Orleans to meet me. But
                            when she got there she found out that instead of going to New Orleans we
                            had been rerouted to Mobile. So she caught a train back to Mobile. </p>

                        <p>Because we left the Chief Mate in Boston, I had to take his job until he
                            caught up with us in New Orleans. I had to be the Chief mate, and we ran
                            with just three mates. I moved into his room as well, because his room
                            was better than mine it was up forward and got the sea breeze from the
                            ship's travel, which at fifteen knots was pretty good. But he had a head
                            of cheese in his closet, which stank to high heaven. I'd never
                            experienced such a thing! I almost threw it overboard, it stank so bad. </p>

                        <p>Anyhow, when we got to New Orleans I asked him &quot;Hey, what's that
                            cheese, Bill?&quot; </p>

                        <p>And he said &quot;What did you do with it?&quot; </p>

                        <p>I said, &quot;I almost threw it over board.&quot; </p>

                        <p>He said, &quot;Did you?!&quot; </p>

                        <p>And I said, &quot;No.&quot; </p>

                        <p>He said, &quot;Well that is Liederkranz. It's good stuff.&quot; </p>

                        <p>Well Bill and I had an apartment ashore, and we feasted on Liederkranz
                            together in New Orleans during Mardi Gras time it was. </p>

                        <p>You asked if I ever went fishing. I guess you meant on the ocean. Our
                            ships usually were going so fast we couldn't fish. One ship could only
                            go 6 miles per hour, and on that one, someone put out a long line and a
                            hook and caught a shark. But he broke the line when we hauled him in, so
                            we didn't catch him. On a tanker I sailed on, I had the job of going
                            around the deck in the morning and picking up the flying fish that
                            landed on the deck. I took them to the cook in the galley to fry for the
                            captains breakfast. And I managed to get him to cook one or two for me.
                            They were a real treat, they tasted so good.</p>

                        <p>I will tell you a sea story that's not really about the sea. Our ship was
                            docked at a dock near Mobile, Alabama, which was by itself on the mouth
                            of a bayou running about three miles into the marshes. We were loading
                            ammunition and equipment there. One of the dock keepers said he had a
                            rowboat he'd sell me. So another sailor and I walked the three miles on
                            a winding road and bought the row boat and a pair of oars and then rowed
                            back out. We discovered that the boat was a pretty good leaker. We had
                            to bail very hard, but couldn't stay afloat. So we beached the boat and
                            tipped it over to pour all the water out. There was a grocery store (a
                            delicatessen) by a bridge we had to row under where we bought a case of
                            beer in cans. We got back in the boat, and christened her <i>The
                                Merry-Open-Bottom</i>. We would row a bit, drinking our beer, until
                            the boat was too full of water, then pull into the bank every so often
                            to bale the boat out. We made it back to the ship, and used the ships
                            derrick to lift the boat aboard. Then we patched it up with canvas and
                            caulking, and painted it and put it back in the water. And for the two
                            weeks we remained in port, my shipmate and I took turns fishing and
                            crabbing and having a lot of fun. When we sailed, we took the boat on
                            board and used it in Panama where we were for three weeks unloading,
                            doing the same thing, but no crabs! </p>

                        <p>We took a load of stuff down to the Panama Canal, came back and were
                            loading again in New Orleans, and Mom came down to New Orleans. This
                            time she went back and forth between New Orleans and Mobile. We rented a
                            furnished room with another couple from Paul's ship. Mom remembers being
                            with Dad when he had terrible sunburn on the backs of his legs from
                            Swimming all day at Lake Ponchartrain. Mom and I witnessed VJ Day
                            [Victory in Japan the end of World War II] there in New Orleans. We
                            never realized at what cost that was, because we never heard on the
                            media that the atom bomb had won the war for us. It wasn't until we came
                            to the Bruderhof years later that we learned the truth of the
                            matter.</p>

                        <p>The war was over, and I wanted to quit the sea. But I was told that I
                            would be drafted if I quit. The Merchant Seamen all were required to
                            stay at their posts until all the troops were brought home, or else
                            they'd be drafted for another two years under the military. So I had to
                            stay at sea still for several more months.</p>

                        <p>We were in New Orleans for VE day. We were loading a cargo for Russia and
                            we took the ship into Gibraltar. The German war was done then so we
                            weren't in convoy anymore, and we sailed along North Africa and up
                            through the islands of the Aegean Sea and were in sight of the Bosphorus
                            when we got orders to turn around; we weren't to proceed to Odessa. So
                            we turned around, and then our boilers went down; so we sailed the
                            length of the Mediterranean west-bound at half speed on one boiler while
                            we repaired and retubed the other boiler. We got a good look at North
                            Africa, Tunisia and Algiers and those countries and wondered about all
                            the pirates that were supposed to come out and catch us; but they never
                            did. We got back to Gibraltar and were waiting for further orders of
                            where to go from there and were told Ok, you turn around and go back to
                            Odessa!</p>

                        <p>We sailed under sealed orders; someone would come on board with a sealed
                            envelope with your orders, and you would proceed. I have no idea where
                            they were coming from, but it was quasi military, I think.</p>

                        <p>Before we got to Odessa we had to go through the Dardanelles and the
                            Bosporus. We anchored for a day or two in the area where Constantinople
                            (Istanbul) is, and you could see all the mosques, and the shipping and
                            everything else. We were not allowed shore liberty there at all. </p>

                        <p>We got into Odessathat was a pretty bleak place. The black market there
                            was lively. I bought a Leica camera for the equivalent of two cartons of
                            cigarettes. About the only diversion there was the opera. We were
                            allowed to attend the opera, and I got to see lots of opera! The one
                            that I enjoyed the best was <i>Faust</i>it was so good that you could
                            almost understand it, even if it was in Russian.</p>

                        <p>*this is the same opera house that Rachoff spoke in.</p>

                        <p>We had a very attractive young girl who was our liaison between the port
                            and the ship. She spoke excellent English and when off duty she could
                            take us around and show us the sights. One day we walked out into the
                            country and I got hold of some Russian black bread. I've never had the
                            likes of it. Two slices and you had a real good meal. But the opera was
                            where we spent most of our time, or going down to the beach and
                            Swimming. We spent two months in Odessa and then we sailed home.</p>

                        <p>I think I had to sign on another ship and I stayed with that ship until
                            VJ Day was past. Then there were two more ships bringing troops home
                            from England and Germany.</p>

                        <p>That last trip blew my mind. I really saw what war was like then. During
                            the times when I was convoying back an d forth across from London to the
                            Normandy beach head, the Germans were firing these robot bombs into
                            England and you could see them going across and you could see the
                            Spitfires chasing them. They could hardly catch them. The only planes
                            that really could were the Lightnings. Anyhow, in the early mornings and
                            late afternoons, flights of bombers would go over; these B17s, B14s, the
                            Lancaster bombers. There would be fifty, a hundred, two hundred bombers
                            going over from England to Germany. They were demolishing Germany at
                            that point. From where we were anchored at the beach head, I can't
                            pronounce it properly, the city of Caena fairly large French city back
                            in from the Normandy coast. That was one of their targets. That night,
                            the whole sky was red over that city. </p>

                        <p>This last ship I was on we were sent into Bremerhaven to pick up troops
                            out of Germany. There you really saw the damage our bombing did. The
                            only thing functioning was the docks. I had shore liberty and walked up
                            through the rubble. That city was <i>flat</i>. You could walk miles and
                            the streets were just barely little paths and where houses had been were
                            piles of rubble. Mile after mile. The only buildings left standing were
                            reinforced concrete buildings that they built. And there weren't many of
                            them. That was the work of our Allied bombers, and I can tell you, it
                            was a sobering sight for me. They had bulldozed the streets out between
                            hills of rubble. I will never forget seeing grandmothers, women and
                            children coming out of holes you wouldn't think animals would live in
                            from the rubble.</p>

                        <p>At that point, finally, the maritime people said we could be discharged
                            if we wanted to, and I jumped at the chance. As soon as I could get off
                            that ship and cashier out, I did. And that was the end of my sea-days.
                            Id done my service and the draft board had no more claims on me. I quit
                            the sea and buried the anchor. When you go ashore to stay ashore, either
                            you bury the anchor, or plant your oar. </p>

                        <h3>With Feet on Dry Land</h3>
                        <h3>Herding Holsteins</h3>

                        <p>The other worthwhile story is about the time Grandpa DuBois, Laurels Dad,
                            went up to Farm and Home week at Ithaca because Laurel was doing some
                            demonstration or other for her Home-Ec class. He was gone for a week,
                            and needed someone to take care of his cows. I happened to be home for a
                            week or ten days at that time, and I took on those cows. Well, Dad was
                            milking about twenty cows three times a day, and I did that, but it was
                            quite a drain - both physically and more so mentally. I had bad dreams
                            about damaging those cows, and I was worried about it because those cows
                            were worth a lot. They were registered, purebred Holsteins. In fact,
                            each of his cows was worth $1000, and in those days that was a lot of
                            money. Anyhow, I had bad dreams about that. When, at the end of five
                            days Dad and Laurel came home, they got there in the afternoon, after
                            the noon milking, and found me sound asleep on the couch. I was tuckered
                            out!</p>

                        <p>Now I think that about does it. That covers everything on this list, so
                            I'll stop for now, and leave the rest of the space for Mama!</p>
